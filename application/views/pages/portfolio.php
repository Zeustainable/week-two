                    <p> Our capstone project was defended last December 2024. We utilized the C#.NET framework along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
                      Bootstrap to develop an online appointment system at Our Lady of the Pillar Medical Center (OLPMC) in Imus, Cavite. The objective 
                      of the study was to reduce patient waiting times and improve the efficiency of appointment management. Moreover, we integrated 
                      doctors’ clinical schedules and HMO/CAAP accreditation. My key responsibilities in our capstone project included being the 
                      full-stack developer, responsible for developing both the front-end and back-end of the appointment system. </p>
